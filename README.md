# 2023_ROMK_LoF
This is a collaborative project where we utilized two approaches to mine three human genome sequencing databases to identify disease-associated mutations in the renal potassium channel, ROMK. The manuscript is under review, but an earlier version is available on bioRxiv: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.05.539609v1. This folder contains additional files that were not included in the main or supplemental materials of the submitted manuscript. These files are:
1. Rhapsody_all_predictions_ROMK: All predictions and probabilities computed by Rhapsody (http://rhapsody.csb.pitt.edu/) for the protein ROMK.
2. Simplified ROC analysis: This file contains data used to compute the ROC curves in S6 Figure.
3. Data_from_graphs: All numerical data used to make the graphs throughout the manuscript were included in this Excel file.
